Download all programs into a single folder, then run Setup.py, which creates the folder setup that is used by the programs. After Setup.py has been run, every other program will be found in \Programs.

The vast majority of this code is not currently well commented, since it was developed with me as the only user in mind. Many of the functions are also specifically designed to produce plots which are only useful for my paper, so they are neither well written nor well commented. I am working on adding comments and an example case.
